                        <p>I was born in Sydney in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. I moved out to Dubbo
                            when I was 4 years old and grew up there. You might be surprised to know that 
                            the zoo isn't the only thing to do in Dubbo - there's a McDonald's there as well!
                            Growing up in Dubbo was great because of the country lifestyle - I love being able
                            to go down to the river with some friends or drive around out of town - the peace
                            and quiet is very special.

                            I completed the IB Diploma Programme at the Central West Leadership Academy. I moved 
                            back to Sydney at the end of January 2025 to accept a position in the BIT Co-op Course
                            at UTS. I have always been interested in programming and development, which is why this 
                            Web Assessment is my dream come true! I love connecting with like-minded people and am
                            so lucky to be able to experience university here in the Big Smoke.

                        <p>My main passion is programming. I didn't take a programming class in high school but I
                            have tried to pursue my interests in my own time. I developed a MacOS application in XCode
                            that uses the Spotify API to collate album covers from a playlist into a custom desktop
                            wallpaper. I based this on my knowledge on the Spotify API which came from my self-directed 
                            Mathematics Internal Assessment in which I built a program to analyse trends in the Triple J 
                            Hottest 100 over time.

                            I also love to play cricket as both a batsman and bowler. Unfortunately as summer is winding down
                            I have taken to reading more, which I also enjoy. I am looking to read The Handmaid's Tale, Demons
                            and Metamorphosis in the near future. I love listening to music, and some of my favorite artists include
                            Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator and Nirvana. I also like to play games and built my own PC last April!

                <p>My website uses a horizontal navbar at the top for navigation between web pages. I am also a very big fan of 
                    outlining all of the webpage's content, which might be very apparent. I am not super into graphic design, but 
                    I tried to use a color pattern including an off-white for the background to make my website as pretty as possible.
                    That being said, while it may not look the flashiest, this website certainly gave me a lot of joy to create as it
                    is yet another excuse to spend a lot of time in VSCode!
