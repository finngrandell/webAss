                    <h2>A BRIEF HISTORY OF ME</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Sydney in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. I moved out to Dubbo
                        when I was 4 years old and grew up there. You might be surprised to know that 
                        the zoo isn't the only thing to do in Dubbo - there's a McDonald's there as well!
                        Growing up in Dubbo was great because of the country lifestyle - I love being able
                        to go down to the river with some friends or drive around out of town - the peace
                        and quiet is very special.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        I completed the IB Diploma Programme at the Central West Leadership Academy. I moved 
                        back to Sydney at the end of January 2025 to accept a position in the BIT Co-op Course
                        at UTS. I have always been interested in programming and development, which is why this 
                        Web Assessment is my dream come true! I love connecting with like-minded people and am
                        so lucky to be able to experience university here in the Big Smoke.

                    <h2>MY HOBBIES</h2>
                    <p>My main passion is programming. I didn't take a programming class in high school but I
                        have tried to pursue my interests in my own time. I developed a MacOS application in XCode
                        that uses the Spotify API to collate album covers from a playlist into a custom desktop
                        wallpaper. I based this on my knowledge on the Spotify API which came from my self-directed 
                        Mathematics Internal Assessment in which I built a program to analyse trends in the Triple J 
                        Hottest 100 over time. 

                        <br><br>

                        I also love to play cricket as both a batsman and bowler. Unfortunately as summer is winding down
                        I have taken to reading more, which I also enjoy. I am looking to read The Handmaid's Tale, Demons
                        and Metamorphosis in the near future. I love listening to music, and some of my favorite artists include
                        Kendrick Lamar, Tyler, the Creator and Nirvana.

                    <h2>MY WEBSITE</h2>
                    <p>My website uses a horizontal navbar at the top for navigation between web pages. I am also a very big fan of 
                        outlining all of the webpage's content, which might be very apparent. I am not super into graphic design, but 
                        I tried to use a color pattern including an off-white for the background to make my website as pretty as possible.
                        That being said, while it may not look the flashiest, this website certainly gave me a lot of joy to create as it
                        is yet another excuse to spend a lot of time in VSCode!
