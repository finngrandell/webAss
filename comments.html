                    <h2>OVERALL STRUCTURE / FUNCTION</h2>
                    <p>I tried to design the website based off a few core modular div elements.
                        The menu bar stays consisent at the top of each web page to provide a 
                        standard navigation system. For all of my spacings I decided to either use 
                        "%" or "em" depending on the context. I created a "row" div element which 
                        has a minimum height of 10em and has a green background which can house
                        "column" elements. These "column" divs use the CSS "flex" property and thus
                        have a variable width depending on how many columns are in each row (2 columns
                        will take 50% of the space each, 3 = 33%, etc.). I also created an "insertedRow" 
                        element that can be placed inside "row" divs to create sub-rows. These can be seen
                        to the left of this column!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <h2>STRUCTURE OF THE INDEX PAGE</h2>
                    <p>The index page utilises a h2 tag below the menu bar to introduce the user to the page.
                        It then uses a "row" div with three columns to talk about my history, hobbies and this website.
                        Each of these sections is brief (and factual) and below this, I am working on developing a CSS 
                        image carousel - stay tuned!

                <div class="column">
                    <h2>STRUCTURE OF THE PAST PAGE</h2>
                    <p>Underneath the Past page's title, another row div holds two columns. The left hand column has three
                        img tags each with an image that supports the content to the right. If the site works as intended, it 
                        should display an Arduino, a screenshot of a program I wrote, and a collage of multiple programming languages. 
                        The right hand column contains three "insertedRow" elements, which each holds a different stage in my programming 
                        journey, from primary school through high school until now!

                    <h2>STRUCTURE OF THE FUTURE PAGE</h2>
                    <p>The Future page simply holds a title and two row divs each with two columns. I describe my internship in the first 
                        row and my goal to pursue full stack development in the second column. I alternated where I placed the text and images
                        in the columns to make the page feel less monotonous and add to the graphic design of the site.

                    <h2>STRUCTURE OF THE COMMENTS PAGE</h2>
                    <p>This page was built modularly like all of my other web pages! There are five row divs, and four of them are split into 
                        two columns. The first three rows describe the overall structure of the website, as well as the individual structure of each of the web pages 
                        (including this one). Below them is a single row with one column that covers the styles used across my website. Finally, there is a discussion 
                        of my graphical design considerations as well as some functional information with the use of the alt tag and how the site works when CSS is turned off.
