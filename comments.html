                            <p>I tried to design the website based off a few core modular div elements.
                                The menu bar stays consisent at the top of each web page to provide a 
                                standard navigation system. The logo in the top left redirects the user to the home page
                                for additional navigation. The menu bar consists of two child elements - the logo image 
                                and an unordered list of links which point to each web page. I used the "display: inline" 
                                styling for all list items to ensure they sat side by side. With the "a:hover" styling, I 
                                made it such that when the cursor hovers over the links in the menu bar, they are styled 
                                with italics and an underline. Additionally, the menu container 
                                div has the styling "justify-content: space-between" which aligns the two elements to the 
                                left and right side of the div and scales with window size. 
                                
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                For all of my spacings I decided to either use 
                                "%" or "em" depending on the context to ensure they were scalable. For instance, the bottom 
                                two images on the right have widths of 50% and 30% respectively to ensure their size is 
                                determined by the size of their containing div. The "Comments!" block uses em sizing to all font 
                                sizes remain relative to each other.

                        <div class="center">
                            <p>One of my core div elements was the "row" and "altrow" divs. They have the same
                                essential styles, except "row" has a light purple background color whilst "altrow"
                                has an off-white color. This allowed me to quickly divide the web pages into different 
                                blocks that stood out from one another. For blocks which required content to be arranged
                                into separate columns, I utilised CSS's 'flexbox' property. By defining a div called 'split'
                                which set the display type to flex, I could assign child divs different flex values depending 
                                on how much space I wanted them to take up. For instance, this "altrow" div contains a "split" 
                                div that splits the space into two equal columns, each taking 50% of the available space, as seen 
                                in the HTML and CSS code on the left.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                I also created consistent styling for page headers, such as "Comments!" seen above, and section 
                                headers, such as "Index Page Structure" seen below. These styles remained consistent across all web 
                                pages to ensure continuity and modular expansion.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row" id="centerAlign">
                <div class="full"><h3 id="subtitle">Index Page Structure</h3></div>
            </div>

            <div class="altrow">
                <div class="split">
                    <div id="fifty">
                        <p>The Index page starts with a page title - "Hi!", inside a "row" div. 
                            The next two subtitles are in "split" div inside an "altrow". The first
                            subtext takes up seventy percent of the parent's width, using "flex: 7", and
                            the other takes up 30%.

                            <br> <br>

                            Then comes another "split" div, with a 50/50 split using the "fifty" id. On 
                            the left side is a "center" div which centers all content vertically and stacks
                            them in a column using display: inline instead of flex. A h3 tag and an image are contained.
                            The right side has a p tag containing text describing my background and life in Dubbo.

                            <br> <br>

                            Below this is another 50/50 "split" div, with the left side containing a simple block of text 
                            enclosed in a "p" tag. On the right side is a h3 tag with class subtext (bolding and increasing font size)
                            with the string "&lt;--". This is because the less than sign is reserved for tag creation in HTML, and thus 
                            "& l t ;" is needed (without the spaces). Below this is another nested 50/50 "split" div, with two ordered lists 
                            of my favorite albums and games of all time respectively.

                            <br> <br>

                            Another "row" tag contains a centered subtitle (with class "subtext") and a simple p tag with no styling, thus 
                            spanning the full width of the div. Another subtitle is placed below, above an "altrow" div containing class 
                            "carousel", which hosts 4 "img" tags. The "carousel" class sets all images within it to be 20% width of the parent div, 
                            but upon hover, they grow to 30% width, creating an interactive element to the webpage.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="fifty">

                    <div id="fifty">
                        <p>All pages henceforth have a page header with the same styling as the index page one, 
                            this one says "My past with computing". Below this is an "altrow" tag that has a 50/50 
                            split. On the left side is a div with class "center" to center all items vertically and horizontally, 
                            containing a h3 tag with class "subtext" and a baby photo of myself (using the "img" tag).

                            <br> <br>

                            Below is a "row' div with a "High School" subtitle spanning the full width of the div. Underneath is 
                            an "altrow" that has a 40/20/40 split using the ids "forty" and "twenty" which set "flex: 4" and "flex: 2"
                            respectively. The left and rightmost divs contain text, whilst the middle contains an image. Another full width 
                            subtitle follows labelled "Personal" with an "altrow" below it. This also has a 40/20/40 split.

                            <br> <br>

                            The leftmost div contains 3 "p" tags, each with a different horizontal alignment depending on their ids.
                            Each of these p tags also grows in size and changes color to purple when the user hovers over it, using 
                            the :hover attribute, to promote interactivity. The middle div contains an image whilst the rightmost contains 
                            a h3 with class "subtext" stating "My PC!""

                            <br> <br>

                            Below this is a 50/50 "split" div - on the left side is a h3 with class "subtext" and on the right is an undordered 
                            list utilising the "ul" tag. Each "li" (list item) has a different component of my PC in it - I chose an unordered 
                            list because the order of the components don't matter. Below is an "altrow" with two centered components - a h3 tag 
                            and a p tag.

                    <p>I tried to design the website based off a few core modular div elements.
                        The menu bar stays consisent at the top of each web page to provide a 
                        standard navigation system. For all of my spacings I decided to either use 
                        "%" or "em" depending on the context. I created a "row" div element which 
                        has a minimum height of 10em and has a green background which can house
                        "column" elements. These "column" divs use the CSS "flex" property and thus
                        have a variable width depending on how many columns are in each row (2 columns
                        will take 50% of the space each, 3 = 33%, etc.). I also created an "insertedRow" 
                        element that can be placed inside "row" divs to create sub-rows. These can be seen
                        to the left of this column!</p>
