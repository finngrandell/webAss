                        to partake in two technical internships over the course of three years. I strive
                        to use this opportunity to further my skills in full stack development and gain as
                        much industry insight as possible. At the moment I am leaning toward interning at 
                        Woolworths Food Group and working with their Data team to expand my knowledge of computing!</p>

                            meaningful programming projects in my profession. Front-end, back-end, I don't mind, as long 
                            as I can work collaboratively to develop great projects! I want to work at a big tech company
                            one day - like Google or Microsoft - but I have to get my career started before I can aim there...

                            with 'big data' and SQL. This Web Systems course has been amazing as an introduction
                            into Bash scripting and has piqued my curiosity significantly in this area.
