                    <h2>INTERNSHIP</h2>
                    <p>As a part of the BIT Co-op Course, I have the opportunity
                    to partake in two technical internships over the course of three years. I strive
                    to use this opportunity to further my skills in full stack development and gain as
                    much industry insight as possible. At the moment I am leaning toward interning at 
                    Woolworths Food Group and working with their Data team to expand my knowledge of computing!</p>

                    <h2>FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                    <p>I have always been interested in programming - whatever form it comes in! I'm not even sure 
                        what major I want to pursue at the moment, but I do know one thing - I want to be working on
                        meaningful programming projects in my profession. Front-end, back-end, I don't mind, as long 
                        as I can work collaboratively to develop great projects! I want to work at a big tech company
                        one day - like Google or Microsoft - but I have to get my career started before I can aim there...
