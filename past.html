                    <div class="insertedRow">My very first experience with coding
                        was in Year 5. My brother and I enrolled in the Premier's 
                        Coding Challenge, which was a competition open to Year 7-8 where
                        students had to use an Arduino to make a fun product. We created a 
                        version of Whack-A-Mole using aluminium foil, a spoon and an Arduino!
                    </div>
                    <div class="insertedRow">During high school, I developed my own program 
                        which analysed the published playlists of Triple J on Spotify to gain
                        insights into track length, song genre and release date. This was a part
                        of my Maths IA assessment where I created an algorithm to predict the makeup
                        of the Hottest 100 over time!

                    <div class="insertedRow">I've since worked on expanding my portfolio of languages.
                        My very first language was Python which my dad taught me, followed by a bit of C++ 
                        to program the Arduino. High school taught me HTML and CSS, and now in university I 
                        am learning about Java and how to implement OOP into Python! I want to learn PHP/SQL
                        to get prepared for Database Fundamentals...
