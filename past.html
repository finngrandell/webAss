                            was in Year 5. My brother and I enrolled in the Premier's 
                            Coding Challenge, which was a competition open to Year 7-8 where
                            students had to use an Arduino to make a fun product. We created a 
                            version of Whack-A-Mole using aluminium foil, a spoon and an Arduino!

                            running. This was completed in a team of 5 where we were tasked with finding
                            and solving cyber security issues in a virtual machine. None of us had any experience
                            with cyber security or operating systems past the application level so serious upskilling
                            was needed. In our first year we placed in the bottom 10% of teams but we were dedicated and 
                            raised ourselves to be top 10% in the nation!

                        My very first language was Python which my dad taught me, followed by a bit of C++ 
                        to program the Arduino. High school taught me HTML and CSS, and now in university I 
                        am learning about Java and how to implement OOP into Python! I want to learn PHP/SQL
                        to get prepared for Database Fundamentals...</p>
